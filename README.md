# 675 Final Project

For my final project, I chose "Option 1: Diving deeper into Mapbox Studio and Mapbox GL JS."

I followed an intermediate Mapbox tutorial on how to analyze data with Turf.js and Mapbox GS JL (the tutorial uses data of libraries and hopsitals in Lexington, which was cool!). Using data of schools and hospitals around Denver, Colorado, my map highlights the nearest hospital when a user clicks on a school. 

In addition to the tutorial, I drew from the following Mapbox GL JS examples when creating my map:
