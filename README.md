# 675 Final Project - Denver Schools & Medical Centers

For my final project in MAP 675, I chose "Option 1: Diving deeper into Mapbox Studio and Mapbox GL JS."

I followed an [intermediate Mapbox tutorial](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/analysis-with-turf/) on how to analyze data with Turf.js and Mapbox GS JL (the tutorial uses data of libraries and hopsitals in Lexington, which was cool!). Using data of schools and medical centers around Denver, Colorado, my map highlights the nearest medical center when a user clicks on a school. 

In addition to the tutorial, the following Mapbox GL JS examples where used when creating my map:

I [displayed a map on a webpage](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/simple-map/).

The map [centers on the school clicked](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/center-on-feature/).

I [restricted user panning](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/restrict-bounds/) to the bounds of Colorado.

[Popups](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/popup/) were added to show the name of all the schools and medical centers symbolized.

[Cooperative gestures](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/cooperative-gestures/) were used to add a full-screen control.

[Mapbox GL directions](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/mapbox-gl-directions/) was added so that users can see the directions between clicked school and closest medical center.
